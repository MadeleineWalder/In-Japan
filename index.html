        <p class="blog-content">
          My first trip to Japan was incredible. During a roughly two week stay in Japan I was mesmerized by how different it was compared to back home in Europe. 
          It was such a cool experience that I never wanted to forget. In an attempt to explain in words what Japan is really like I ended up writing a list of little 
          things that are different over there. This list quickly grew a lot larger than I was expecting, so now it has become a blog I guess! It will also be a great 
          excuse to use some of the best photos we took. I hope you enjoy!

        <h3>Hi there!</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a junior web developer and travel enthusiast.
          I made this website for my blog and it was really fun to 
          combine my love for frontend design and travelling.

        <p class="blog-content">
          This was one of the first things I noticed when we arrived at the hotel and went to unpack and shower. I knew the toilet would have a bidet because that's something 
          everybody knows is super common in Japan. But I wasn't expecting the amount of buttons and things they can do. However thereâ€™s no button for the heated seat, you will 
          have it on constantly whether you want it or not.  At first I kept forgetting about it and then being surprised when I sat down, but after a while it was quite nice. 
          I didn't take any photos of the toilet because that felt weird.
