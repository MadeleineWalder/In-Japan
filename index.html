              My first trip to Japan was incredible. During a roughly two week stay in Japan I was mesmerized by how different it was compared to back home in Europe. 
              It was such a cool experience that I never wanted to forget. In an attempt to explain in words what Japan is really like I ended up writing a list of little 
              things that are different over there. This list grew a lot larger than I was expecting so now it has become a blog I guess. (Also it's an excuse to use some 
              of the photos!)
